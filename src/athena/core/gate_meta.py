gate_meta.py — Meta-awareness classification engine module (v3.1).
Exposes classify() and REMINDER_TEMPLATE for SDK-wide use.

v3.1 (2026-09-05): Recall hardening from red-team audit. Added T1b
bare-narration institutional anchors, present-tense verb conjugations,
T1p counterparty-probe markers (Nacho-$20), T2b open-verb outbound,
T5b felt-evidence variants, Singlish word order, and relational drift.
Extended NEGATIVE guard for routine-ops institutional noun contexts.

META-AWARENESS GATE (hook v3, code-enforced) — fired: {classes}
Interpreter kernel — answer each question before responding (Prior -> Discriminators -> Payoff):
1. ARENA: What container is this, and what is its IMPLICIT contract (not the stated one)?
2. PRIOR: What is this arena's base rate? (substance-decode Module 3 library.)
3. DISCRIMINATORS: Which verifiable details move the prior? List them, or state "none — prior holds".
4. SIGN CHECK (MP-16): Is the working read inflating (self-flattering) or deflating (self-degrading)?
   Would I accept this read if the sign were flipped? Correct both with equal rigor.
5. RECEIVER FRAME (outbound, SimToM order): What does the receiver OBSERVE, intent stripped?
   What is their worst plausible SELF-referential decode ("what does this say about ME?")?
6. F != R: Is felt intensity being offered as evidence? It measures the feeler, not the world.
7. PAYOFF: What does each misread cost? Act on the asymmetry, not the point estimate.
8. INTAKE / OPERATOR (T6/T7): Does the brief mandate this sector, or are you over-indexing on a CV?
   Will the actual presenter understand and comfortably defend every technical term in this script?
9. AGENCY (anti-override): if ranking or advising, weight by the USER'S revealed preferences.
Guards: capital/position sizing -> trading-risk-gate. Sincere read in payoff table.
