"""
athena.core.security — Runtime security hardening.
==================================================

Mitigates CVE-2025-69872 (CVSS 7.3, published 2026-02-11): the ``diskcache``
library (through 5.6.3) deserializes cache entries with ``pickle`` by default.
An attacker who can WRITE to a cache directory can plant a malicious pickle that
executes arbitrary code when the cache is next read. In Athena, ``diskcache``
is only ever a *transitive* dependency (via fastmcp / flashrank) — the package's
own query cache (``athena.core.cache``) is JSON and unaffected.

Threat model (local-first, single-user): an attacker who can write to your
cache directory already has local code execution, so the practical risk is low.
This module applies the advisory's *own* recommended remediation as
defense-in-depth for the shared-volume / container / multi-user case:

    1. Restrict cache/state directory permissions to 0700 (owner-only) so other
       local users cannot plant a malicious pickle.
    2. If ``dspy`` happens to be loaded in-process, swap its ``FanoutCache`` to
       the pickle-free JSON disk backend. Best-effort only; this module NEVER
       imports ``dspy`` itself (it is not an Athena dependency).

Everything here is best-effort and must never raise into the boot sequence.

Epistemic status: code-enforced. ``apply_diskcache_hardening()`` runs at boot
(see ``athena.boot.orchestrator``) and the directory chmod is verifiable.
