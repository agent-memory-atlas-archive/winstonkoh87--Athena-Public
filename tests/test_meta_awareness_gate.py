# ------------------------------------------------- Golden historical cases
#
# Known-answer reads: each case carries the exact set of classes it must
# produce, not merely "something fired".
#
# The previous form asserted `len(fired(prompt)) > 0`, which made the suite
# unable to detect a change in *which* class fires. 755486a rewrote every one
# of these prompts to sanitize names — one case changed scenario entirely, from
# a tournament final round to a last week at a job — and the suite stayed green
# because it never checked a classification. A calibration suite that cannot
# detect recalibration is decoration.
#
# These are golden files: when the gate legitimately changes a classification,
# update the expected set here in the same commit, deliberately.
